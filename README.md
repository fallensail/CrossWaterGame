# CrossWaterGame
a final game project from a software development class
By Peiheng Hu and Sail Wu

Run the following in your command line:
./shallow_water_extension_with_ball data/tub3.* 0

Trouble shooting:
If your computer is too slow, the game may become very easy as the fire balls moves too small.

Below is the rule designed to play this game:
1.	Accomplish the task within 10 seconds 
2.	Use arrow keys on the board to safely move the green object to the pink area on the other side without touching any moving fire balls.
3.	Game ends immediately when the green object touches the any moving fire balls.
4.	Different scene will be shown at the end depending on if user wins or not.

If you successfully accomplish the task, a spherical ball will drop into water surface. 
Otherwise, you will see a skull showing in the window.
